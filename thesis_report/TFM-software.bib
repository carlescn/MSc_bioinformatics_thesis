@book{VanRossum2009,
abstract = {PYTHON 3 Reference Manual (Python Documentation MANUAL Part 2).Python is an easy to learn object-oriented programming language, which combines power with clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level data types, and dynamic typing. Python is free software. It can be used with GNU (GNU/Linux), Unix, Microsoft Windows and many other systems.This is a printed softcover copy of the official Python documentation from the latest Python 3.0 distribution. For each copy sold $1 will be donated to the Python Software Foundation by the publisher.This book is part of a brand new six-part series of Python documentation books. Searching for "Python Documentation Manual" will show all six available books.ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Guido van Rossum, is the inventor of Python. Fred L. Drake, Jr. is the official editor of the Python documentation.},

@book{Xie2016,
abstract = {bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown presents a much easier way to write books and technical publications than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},

@inproceedings{Ghemawat2016,
abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that Tensor-Flow achieves for several real-world applications.},
