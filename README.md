This repository contains
my implementation of some deep clustering models
used in my MSc thesis.
It also contains
the code used to train the models
on multiple datasets
and a summary of the clustering performances achieved.

The deep learning models implemented are:

- AE (Autoencoder)
- DEC (Deep Embedded Clustering) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114v10]()
- VAE (Variational Autoencoder) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335v2]()
- VaDE (Variational Deep Embedding) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05148v3]()
